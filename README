= Bukkit-Blight

== DESCRIPTION
Bukkit-Blight is a Bukkit plugin for Minecraft that creates a user-configurable blight upon the land!

== INSTALLATION
1. Install Bukkit (http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server)
1. Download blight.jar
1. Place blight.jar in Bukkit /plugins directory
1. Start or reload your server

== USAGE
<b>BACK UP YOUR WORLD!</b> This mod behaves in unpredictable and destructive ways. It would be a pity to lose anything you care about.

To give yourself permissions to start a blight, either become an op (Bukkit server console: /op your_character_name) or give yourself the blight permission.

To start a blight: Enter /blight in the console. The blight will spread from any block where you have done this.

== TODO
* Add /blight commands to set config file values in game
* Allow way of disabling the blight
